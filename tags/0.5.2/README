@section hello_section  Hello my friend,
I give you this software under the terms of the GNU LGPL.\n
I hope you appreciate it and have a nice day.\n
\n
\n
\n
\n
The purpose of this software is to simplify the interaction between the OpenAL
API and the OpenSceneGraph transforming conventions.\n
Once per frame, each pSound::Source computes its own transformation in the
model-view reference frame. This works fine as long as the listener has
identity matrix, so the Listener singleton should never be accessed.\n
There are two examples in the "examples" folder.\n
\n
\n
Requires OpenAL and OSG
